## 🏥 EDA of Hospital Admission Data

### 📊 Project Description

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a hospital dataset to uncover patterns related to patient admissions, discharge dates, gender distribution, age groups, admission types, and departmental statistics.

The analysis was conducted using **Python** in **Google Colab** and includes the use of common libraries such as:

* `pandas` for data manipulation
* `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization
* `datetime` for date processing

---

### 🔍 Objectives

* Understand the structure and content of the hospital dataset
* Analyze patient age distribution and common age groups
* Identify the most common **admission types** (e.g., Emergency, OPD)
* Determine the **departments with the highest number of admissions**
* Analyze **gender-based admission trends**
* Discover the **day of the week with most admissions**
* Visualize key patterns in the data

---

### 📁 Files Included

* `EDA_of_Hospital_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all EDA steps and visualizations
* `HDHI Admission data.csv`: The main dataset used
* Additional `.csv` files (e.g., mortality or pollution data) if included

---

### 📈 Key Insights

* Most admissions were of type **Emergency (E)**.
* Departments such as **General Medicine** and **Pediatrics** had the highest admission counts.
* Males were admitted slightly more than females in this dataset.
* The most common age group was between **50 to 60 years**.
* Most admissions occurred on **Mondays and Tuesdays**.
